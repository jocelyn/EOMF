# Eiffel Object Modelling Framework (EOMF)

EOMF is a holding project for various generic facilities for Eiffel applications, including:

* ODIN - Object Data Instance Notation - parser, validator, internal Data Tree representation, and serialiser for [ODIN notation](https://github.com/openEHR/odin). 

* BMM - Basic Meta-Model - an object schema representation facility. BMM schemas represent object data models, including classes and attributes with open and closed generics, inheritance etc. BMM files are written in ODIN syntax. [Examples](https://github.com/openEHR/reference-models/tree/master/models/openEHR/Release-1.0.2/BMM) used on openEHR.

* App resources - inheritable classes containing useful resources, like access to inline icons, standard app paths, etc.

* App config file, in ODIN format

* EVX - layer over Eiffel Vision EV lib to provide higher level controls with built-in agents, visual settings.

* ISO 8601 date/time library [here](library/app_support/date_time).

* Error reporting objects

* various vendor fixes for ISE Eiffel.
